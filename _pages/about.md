Hello, I'm Boxiang, a research scientist at [Baidu Research Institute](http://research.baidu.com/Index) and a scientific advisor for [Genenexus](http://www.genenexus.com/). I am a computational biologist and a statistician by training, with a deep interest in the intersection between genetics, medicine and machine learning. 

Please see [Research]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/research.md %}) for my previous and current research activities and [Publication]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/publications.md %}) for examples of my work. The [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/resources.md %}) page lists software and tools and their accompanying papers. Please see [Work with us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/work-with-us.md %}) if you are interested in joining Baidu Research Institute or Genenexus. Also feel free to reach out for collaboration or to simply chat about research!
