 abstract = {As a kind of magnetic microspheres with good biocompatibility, biodegradability and environmental friendliness, magnetic starch was widely applied in many fields such as biomaterials, drug targeting and clinical medicine. In this paper, the method of synthesis of magnetic starch, and the factors such as temperature, pH, reaction time and concentration of FeCl2 were investigated. The optimum synthesis conditions were established by determining the Fe content in the magnetic starch with colorimetric method. Based on the …},

@article{wirka2019atheroprotective,
 abstract = {In response to various stimuli, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can de-differentiate, proliferate and migrate in a process known as phenotypic modulation. However, the phenotype of modulated SMCs in vivo during atherosclerosis and the influence of this process on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk have not been clearly established. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomic phenotype of modulated SMCs in vivo in atherosclerotic lesions of both mouse and human …},

@article{wu2018ubiquitination,
 abstract = {Translation of mRNAs is tightly regulated and constantly surveyed for errors. Aberrant translation can trigger co-translational protein and RNA quality control processes, impairments of which cause neurodegeneration by still poorly understood mechanism (s). Here we show that quality control of translation of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)-localized mRNA intersects with the turnover of damaged mitochondria, both orchestrated by the mitochondrial kinase PINK1. Mitochondrial damage causes stalled translation of …},

@article{yang2017identifying,
 abstract = {The impact of inherited genetic variation on gene expression in humans is well-established. The majority of known expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) impact expression of local genes (cis-eQTLs). More research is needed to identify effects of genetic variation on distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and understand their biological mechanisms. One common trans-eQTLs mechanism is “mediation” by a local (cis) transcript. Thus, mediation analysis can be applied to genome-wide SNP and expression data in order to identify transcripts that are “cis …},
