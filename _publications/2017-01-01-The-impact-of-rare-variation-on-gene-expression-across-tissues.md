Rare genetic variants are abundant in humans and are expected to contribute to individual disease risk 1, 2, 3, 4. While genetic association studies have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with susceptibility, these studies are not practical for identifying rare variants 1, 5. Efforts to distinguish pathogenic variants from benign rare variants have leveraged the genetic code to identify deleterious protein-coding alleles 1, 6, 7, but no analogous code exists for non-coding variants. Therefore, ascertaining which rare â€¦
