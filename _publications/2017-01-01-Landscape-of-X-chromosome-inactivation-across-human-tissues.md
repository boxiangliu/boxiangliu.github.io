X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences transcription from one of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells to balance expression dosage between XX females and XY males. XCI is, however, incomplete in humans: up to one-third of X-chromosomal genes are expressed from both the active and inactive X chromosomes (Xa and Xi, respectively) in female cells, with the degree of &apos;escape&apos;from inactivation varying between genes and individuals 1, 2. The extent to which XCI is shared between cells and tissues remains poorly â€¦
