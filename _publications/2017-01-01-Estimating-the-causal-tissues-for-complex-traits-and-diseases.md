How to interpret the biological causes underlying the predisposing markers identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remains an open question. One direct and powerful way to assess the genetic causality behind GWAS is through analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Here we describe a new approach to estimate the tissues behind the genetic causality of a variety of GWAS traits, using the cis-eQTLs in 44 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium. We have adapted the â€¦
