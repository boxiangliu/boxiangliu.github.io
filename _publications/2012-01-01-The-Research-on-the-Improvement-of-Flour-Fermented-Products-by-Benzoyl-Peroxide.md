Article Preview Article Preview Article Preview This paper studied improved properties for fermented products by Benzoyl peroxide. The proofing speed and whiteness is as the index, this paper studied the use effect by adding different concentration and temperature of BPO, and discussed the influence on rheological properties. Research shows: the BPO optimal adding quantities are 40mg/kg for the improvement of fermented products. It can not only improve the proofing speed and food quality of fermented products, but also be able to â€¦
