Retrogradation play the conclusive action on biological value and biodegradable of starch. In the paper, the influence of amylose contents, humidity and emulsifier type on hardness and the influence of emulsifiers on viscocity of waxy starch were investigated. The peak temperature range and retrogradation enthalpy of retrogradation starch were analysed by DSC. The result showed that the relation between the degree of retrogradation of starch and amylose contents or moisture content were positive correlation. Emulsifiers retarded the â€¦
