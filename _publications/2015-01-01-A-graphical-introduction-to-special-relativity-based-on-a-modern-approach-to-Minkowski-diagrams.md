We present a comprehensive introduction to the kinematics of special relativity based on Minkowski diagrams and provide a graphical alternative to each and every topic covered in a standard introductory sequence. Compared to existing literature on the subject, our introduction of Minkowski diagrams follows a more structured and contemporary approach. This work also demonstrates new ways in which Minkowski diagrams can be used and draws several new insights from the diagrams constructed. In this regard, the sections that â€¦
