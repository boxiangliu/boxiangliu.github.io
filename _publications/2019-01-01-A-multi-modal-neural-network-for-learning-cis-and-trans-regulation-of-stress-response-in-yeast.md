Deciphering gene regulatory networks is a central problem in computational biology. Here, we explore the use of multi-modal neural networks to learn predictive models of gene expression that include cis and trans regulatory components. We learn models of stress response in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our models achieve high performance and substantially outperform other state-of-the-art methods such as boosting algorithms that use pre-defined cis-regulatory features. Our model learns several cis and â€¦
