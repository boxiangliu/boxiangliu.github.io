The resources generated by the GTEx consortium offer unprecedented opportunities to advance our understanding of the biology of human traits and diseases. Here, we present an in-depth examination of the phenotypic consequences of transcriptome regulation and a blueprint for the functional interpretation of genetic loci discovered by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Across a broad set of complex traits and diseases, we find widespread dose-dependent effects of RNA expression and splicing, with higher impact on â€¦
