Starch is an important ingredient for food and other industries. Modified starch has better properties than natural starch. Phosphorylation is one of the effective techniques to improve the functional properties of starch and to modify its behavior in terms of gelatinization, pasting, and retrogradation. Phosphorus is the effective component of phosphate, and it is one kind of important nutritional ingredient in functional foods. This article summarizes the modification of starch by phosphorus and the application of phosphorylated starch in the â€¦
