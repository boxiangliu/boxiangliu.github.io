The distribution of sum of independent non-identical binomial random variables is frequently encountered in areas such as genomics, healthcare, and operations research. Analytical solutions to the density and distribution are usually cumbersome to find and difficult to compute. Several methods have been developed to approximate the distribution, and among these is the saddlepoint approximation. However, implementation of the saddlepoint approximation is non-trivial and, to our knowledge, an R package is still lacking. In this â€¦
