To the Editor—Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are rapidly expanding the catalog of trait-and disease-associated variants. With increasing cohort size and phenotyping, GWAS have identified more than 70,000 associated variants 1. Because as many as 90% of GWAS variants fall within non-coding regions, most of them have unknown functional importance 2. To aid in interpreting these variants, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies provide data on whether a variant of interest is also associated with gene expression …
