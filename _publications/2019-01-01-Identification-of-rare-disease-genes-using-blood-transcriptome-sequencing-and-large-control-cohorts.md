It is estimated that 350 million individuals worldwide suffer from rare diseases, which are predominantly caused by mutation in a single gene 1. The current molecular diagnostic rate is estimated at 50%, with whole-exome sequencing (WES) among the most successful approaches 2, 3, 4, 5. For patients in whom WES is uninformative, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has shown diagnostic utility in specific tissues and diseases 6, 7, 8. This includes muscle biopsies from patients with undiagnosed rare muscle disorders 6, 9, and cultured â€¦
