A new method using nuclear imaging technology for determining freshness of harvested carp is presented. This research attempted to determine freshness of carp by measuring radioactive area increasment (RAI) value of the fish. The Carp samples were maintained under refrigerated condition for 12 days, and RAI and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) values were determined during storage. The results showed that RAI values increased as the total TVB-N content increased during storage. Also, there was a significant correlation â€¦
