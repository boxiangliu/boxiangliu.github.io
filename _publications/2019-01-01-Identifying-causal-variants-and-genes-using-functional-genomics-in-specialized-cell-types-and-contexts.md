A central goal in human genetics is the identification of variants and genes that influence the risk of polygenic diseases. In the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified tens of thousands of genetic loci associated with various diseases. Since the majority of such loci lie within non-coding regions and have many candidate variants in linkage disequilibrium, it has been challenging to accurately identify specific causal variants and genes. To aid in their discovery a variety of statistical and experimental approaches â€¦
