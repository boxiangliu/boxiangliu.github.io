As a kind of magnetic microspheres with good biocompatibility, biodegradability and environmental friendliness, magnetic starch was widely applied in many fields such as biomaterials, drug targeting and clinical medicine. In this paper, the method of synthesis of magnetic starch, and the factors such as temperature, pH, reaction time and concentration of FeCl2 were investigated. The optimum synthesis conditions were established by determining the Fe content in the magnetic starch with colorimetric method. Based on the â€¦
