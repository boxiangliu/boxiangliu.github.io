Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a conserved post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by ADAR enzymes that diversifies the transcriptome by altering selected nucleotides in RNA molecules 1. Although many editing sites have recently been discovered 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the extent to which most sites are edited and how the editing is regulated in different biological contexts are not fully understood 8, 9, 10. Here we report dynamic spatiotemporal patterns and new regulators of RNA editing, discovered through an â€¦
